## How to Play
### Controls
- W: Jump
- A: Move counter-clockwise around the planet you are standing on
- S: Move clockwise around the planet you are standing on
- D: When in the air, press D to fall down to the nearest planet faster
- Space/Left Click: Pressing will shoot a small projectile. Holding, then releasing the button will charge then release a larger projectile that will move faster

### Playing the Game
- Hit your enemies with your projectiles to deal damage and get your enemies' health bars to 0
- Be the last person standing to win
- Both you and your projectiles will be affected by the gravity of each planet, so the key to winning is using the orbit of your projectiles to your advantage.
